# fast-scroll

Ever run into scrolling issues that drive you crazy? (pauses and lag
when trying to run through the buffer)

If you have a fair amount of packages and customizations (particularly
if they are mode-line / font-lock heavy) then this is the package to
help alleviate that a bit for you.

It works by temporarily disabling font-lock and switching to a
barebones mode-line, until you stop scrolling (at which point it re-enables).
